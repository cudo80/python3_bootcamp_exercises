'''
I´m having a party and made a list of people I want to invite.
Unfortunately, I´m a terrible friend and made a couple of spelling errors.
Help me correct them!

- Change "Hanna" to "Hannah" (there should be an "h" at the end)
- Change "Geoffrey" to "Jeffrey"
- Change "aparna" to "Aparna" (capitalize it)
'''

people = ["Hanna", "Louisa", "Claudia", "Angela", "Geoffrey", "aparna"]

# Change "Hanna" to "Hannah"
people[0] = "Hannah"
# Change "Geoffrey" to "Jeoffrey"
people[4] = "Jeffrey"
# Change "aparna" to "Aparna"
people[-1] = "Aparna"
