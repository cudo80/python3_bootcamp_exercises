'''
A list called sounds is given, it looks like this:
sounds = ["super", "cali", "fragil", "istic", "expi", "ali", "docious"]
- Write code that loops over the list and adds all the strings together to form one large combined
string (donÂ´t add any spaces between them)
- The combined string should be in all uppercase as well
- Save the result in a variable called result
'''

sounds = ["super", "cali", "fragil", "istic", "expi", "ali", "docious"]

result = ""
for sound in sounds:
    result += sound.upper()
