Using list comprehension, create a variable called answer with the following value:
[
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
]

It´s a 10x10 nested list.
10 rows, each row contains the numbers 0-9. Don´t worry about the fomratting/spacing,
I just added a bunch of returns to make things clearer. Your answer will be all on giant line.
Use nested list comprehension and range() to accomplish this.

answer = [[x for x in range(0, 10)] for nums in range(0, 10)]
